          <h2><p>So eto na nga,</p></h2>
          <p>How can I capture the essence of sincerity just by writing you this letter? Therefore, I know â€” no words will ever be enough. Yet here I am, trying, making this ordinary letter into somewhat plausible for you to feel what I feel even if our distance makes it impossible for us to be together. </p> 
          
          <p>Let me start this letter by gathering all of my emotions and courage that I possess â€” because the things I feel towards you needs to be said in a meaningful way. </p>
          
          <p>I never saw it coming. I think I was just dreaming about the things we have right now because it's so unbelievable for me. Truly, life is full of surprises. All of the events that have occurred just for us to meet is somewhat out of a romance novel.</p> 
          
          <p>Things started casual. However, time passes us by and the bond that we made grew bigger than I expected, days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months, hoping that months will turn into years. Letting you inside is such a bold move that I've made, despite the traumas and the fear that I constantly feel. </p> 
          
          <p>I've totally fallen for you. You give me this weird feeling every time I see your name in my notifications, every time you message me. Is this what they call butterflies? I don't knowâ€¦ maybe? I looked it up, and it perfectly describes how I feel, ngemmm baka langgg ewann ko huhu. </p>
          
          <p>I stay up all night just so I could talk to you about some weird shts. Even you, telling me how your day went, it excites me if it's about you. I want you to yap at me everytime, I want to listen you all day long. I just careee ano baaa >.< </p> 
          
          <p>I get anxious everytime I wonder if I'm treating you right the way you deserve this time? Are you not annoyed with me? Is there something I'm doing that hurts you? That's why I'm so cautious. If I ever misstep, please tell me.</p>
          
          <p>I always try my best to be better for you. I am not "them", I am me. </p> 
          
          <p>I want to learn more about you â€” to understand the deepest part of your thoughts, feelings, and the back stories that shape you the way you are right now. I long to stand and stay beside you when you need someone to be there for you and scream all of your. I really do want to witness you show all your emotions. Let me be that annoying "ngilaw" in your freaking peaceful life that chooses you again-and-again to annoy you.</p> 
          
          <p>You know, I want to be there for you, beside you while you are healing. I want to see you grow with help of mine. Scared? Afraid? It's okay to feel that way, because of the traumas that you experienced from your past. And if you're scared or unsure, that's okay, babyyyyyy. I don't expect you to have it all together. </p> 
          
          <p>You don't have to rush anything with me. I'm here to stay, through the upss and downsss, the silence, the overthinking, the "I don't know what's wrong" kind of nights. I'll be here for you through every version of yourself babyyy.</p>
          
           <p>You're not a burden, never will be. You're a person worth waiting for, worth fighting for, and undeniably deserving of love. </p>
           
           <p>I just want you to know that I'm someone you can trust â€” fully, completely, and without fear. I'll never make you feel like your emotions are not valid. I'll protect your heart the best way I can.</p> 
           
           <p>And as I said, I always say to youu babyy, I'll give you reassurance every single day if that's what it takes. I'll remind you that you're seen, loved, wanted, and more than enough over and over until you truly believe it. I'll be patient with your healing, gentle with your heart, and consistent. No matter how many times you doubt yourself, or how many times you doubt me, I'll be here with you.</p> 
           
           <p>I appreciate you more than words can describe it. I want to give you what you deserve. Age is just a number and distance is just space. If you stay, I'll stay. If you fight for us, I'll fight for it too. Just so you know, I really do care about you.</p> 
           
           <p>You're worth every risk, every step that I make. You'll be the one who I choose today, tomorrow, and every day after. And if you'll let me, I'll prove it to you that no one will be the same as me pooooo</p>
           
           <p>Thank you for making the first move, nu haannn kuma edi awan kastuy ta ita HAHAHAHAHA. Thank you for risking your heart. For someone like me, for making me feel loved and seen, and for being there when I needed you. Now, let me take the lead. You've done enough â€” you've stepped forward in ways I never expected, like damn am I the girl? And I'm disappointed in myself for letting you carry that responsibility alone.</p> 
           
           <p>I'll take it from here. So let me say it clearly now â€” I like you, Althea. And let me ask you one thing, may I court you? (edit: im already courting you HAHHAHAHAHA). You are the risk that I am willing to take.</p>
          
           <p>Babyyyy, you're not "too much." You're not "hard to love." You are worth it. Always. MUAHHHHHHHH </p>
           
           <p>Please don't think this love is temporary â€” na parang sa una lang masaya, tapos mawawala din. Pero hindi ako nagmamadali, hindi tayo magmamadali. This love is not that ano, yung puro excitement lang o yung mga kilig nga maawan nu bumayag. It's choosing each other even on days the spark feels quiet. Gusto kong maging safe space mo kahit anong mood mo. Okay lang sa'kin kahit anong mood mo. Pagod ka? G lang. Bad day? Andito ako. Hindi ka sure? no pressure. Adda talaga dagidyay aldaw nga awan ta same page. ngem ano e, adda talaga knyatayo nu pilyem ba wenno haan.</p>
           
           <p>We might hurt each other, misunderstand things, or even fight. But I hope that we could solve and walk through all of this willingly instead of going to sleep with a heavy heart in both of our hearts.</p>
           
           <p>I might be an understanding person but sometimes I get confused, thinking what just happened? I really hate these kind of feelings ngem ana maaramidak, I don't want to be an annoyance to you so I just keep it for myself, looking into both positive and negative shipsss.</p> 
           
           <p>Do what you want to do, I understand. We have different lives anyway. You don't even need to respond to this. Just letting you know that you are safe with me I'll reassure you always. </p> 
           
           <p>You deserve more, and that is why I am shaping myself into the person worthy of you, the one who can meet your expectations and offer you the respect and love you are worthy of.</p> 
           
           <p>As for the reasoning behind all of this â€” well, I am a programmer, remember? I once said I longed to create something truly uniqueâ€¦ and this is it â€” a site made for my confession HAHAHAHAHAHH. I just wanted to be uniq, so that I can be the only one that do these kind of things. Originally, my intention was to put everything into a letter â€” a longggggg assssss written letter HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH</p> 
           
           <p>So yes, every word I spoke was true â€” I'm seryos asf w/ u, no other words can describe it. I want to show you "me", I want to pursue you for realll, and I am prepared to embrace every risk, even if it means both of us may wound each other. </p> 
           
           <p>Let's not overthink the future too much and focus on building what we are and what we have right now, the present. I believe in what we have right now, and I'm willing to put in the effort to make it grow. </p> 
           
           <p>You are more than enough. No matter what happens, I'll always cherish what we have.</p>
           
           <p>Thank you for letting me feel this way â€” it's terrifying and beautiful all at once. And I mean every word I said. Let me be your man, babyyyy :333</p>
          
           <p>LABYOOOOOOOOOOO, I HOPEE YOU ENJOYEDDD TODIYYYY (awannn emojiii pcc nehhhh) MWAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHPS </p>
